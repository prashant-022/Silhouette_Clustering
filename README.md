# Silhouette_Clustering
For unsupervised ML techniques, clustering in classification problems is better way to go ahead.
KMeans is a method present in sklearn module. This is used to make clusters among the given dataset. We need to know that in how many clusters the dataset 
should be grouped. Here, ELBOW METHOD comes into picture which provides us a better K-value by graphical representation. 
Silhouette Clustering Algorithm is used validate those K-values chosen. And it also tells which K-value should be choosen. Since, it has range of [-1,+1], higher towards +1 better is the clustering.
If it is negative, that means clustering not done well.
